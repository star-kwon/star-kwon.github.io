  Hi, my name's Taesung and I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate in KAIST, advised by Prof. Jong Chul Ye and Prof. Mooseok Jang. My research focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in computer vision (CV) and its intersection with Diffusion models. I'm driven to leverage capabilities of diffuion models to solve wide-range of inverse problems.

  My work explores three key areas:

  * Video Inverse Problems (Deblur, Super-resolution, Inpaint)

  * Video Frame Interpolation

  * Inverse Scattering in Optics
  
  Also, I'm interested in computational imaging, and weakly- and self-supervised learning.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
